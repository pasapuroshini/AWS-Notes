#### **What is the Cloud?**

*   Traditionally, companies maintained **hardware infrastructure** (compute, storage, networking) in **on-premises data centers**.
    
*   Maintaining physical data centers was **costly** and required dedicated IT teams.
    
*   As **internet usage** grew, maintaining large data centers became **unsustainable** for many organizations.
    
*   **Cloud computing** was created to **deliver IT resources on-demand** over the internet, using a **pay-as-you-go** model.
    

#### **Cloud Computing Definition**

*   **Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery** of IT resources over the **internet** with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.
    
*   Instead of maintaining physical hardware, companies use services from cloud providers like **AWS**.
    
*   AWS owns and operates data centers, providing **virtualized IT resources** that users can access remotely.
    

#### **On-Premises vs. Cloud Workloads**

**Example Scenario:**

*   Developers need a **QA environment** to test a new feature.
    
*   **On-Premises:**
    
    *   Buy and install new hardware.
        
    *   Connect cables, provision power, install OS, configure settings.
        
    *   **Takes days to complete** → **Delays time-to-market**.
        
*   **Cloud Computing:**
    
    *   Replicate the **exact same environment** in **minutes or seconds**.
        
    *   No need for physical setup → **Faster deployment**.
        

#### **Benefits of Cloud Computing**

1.  **Pay as You Go**
    
    *   No upfront hardware investments.
        
    *   Pay only for what you use.
        
2.  **Economies of Scale**
    
    *   AWS serves millions of customers, reducing per-user costs.
        
    *   Large-scale operations result in lower prices for customers.
        
3.  **Stop Guessing Capacity**
    
    *   Scale resources up or down **on demand**.
        
    *   No risk of **over-provisioning** (wasting money) or **under-provisioning** (running out of resources).
        
4.  **Increase Speed & Agility**
    
    *   Provision resources **within minutes** instead of weeks.
        
    *   Faster experimentation & product development.
        
5.  **Reduce Infrastructure Costs**
    
    *   No need to manage **physical servers** and **data centers**.
        
    *   Focus on business & customers, not IT infrastructure.
        
6.  **Go Global in Minutes**
    
    *   Deploy applications **worldwide** using AWS **Regions** & **Availability Zones**.
        
    *   Improve **latency** and user experience globally.
        

#### **AWS Role in Cloud Computing**

*   AWS provides **various cloud services** to build **scalable, cost-effective, and highly available** applications.
    
*   Instead of managing hardware, businesses can **leverage AWS services** to focus on **innovation and customers**.
    

#### **Conclusion**

*   Cloud computing enables **faster**, **cheaper**, and **more flexible** infrastructure management.
    
*   AWS helps businesses **reduce costs**, **scale dynamically**, and **increase agility** without dealing with physical infrastructure.
