*   **IAM Overview**:
    
    *   IAM is a web service that helps manage access to AWS accounts and resources.
        
    *   It controls authentication (who can enter) and authorization (what actions they can perform).
        
    *   IAM eliminates the need to share root credentials by allowing granular access control.
        
*   **IAM Features**:
    
    *   **Global Service**: IAM is not region-specific.
        
    *   **Integrated with AWS Services**: Works across AWS.
        
    *   **Password Policies**: You can enforce security rules.
        
    *   **Supports MFA**: Enhances security.
        
    *   **Identity Federation**: Enables external users to access AWS securely.
        
*   **IAM Users**:
    
    *   IAM users represent people or services that interact with AWS.
        
    *   Each user has unique credentials (passwords for console access, access keys for CLI/API access).
        
    *   IAM users should not be granted excessive permissions directly.
        
*   **IAM Groups**:
    
    *   Groups simplify permission management by allowing multiple users to inherit permissions.
        
    *   Best practice: Assign users to groups (e.g., Developers, Admins, Security).
        
    *   Users can belong to multiple groups.
        
    *   Groups cannot contain other groups.
        
*   **IAM Policies**:
    
    *   IAM policies define what actions users/groups/roles can perform.
        
    *   Policies are JSON-based documents with elements like:
        
        *   **Version**: Specifies policy language version.
            
        *   **Effect**: Either "Allow" or "Deny".
            
        *   **Action**: Specifies allowed/denied AWS actions (e.g., "s3:ListBucket").
            
        *   **Resource**: Defines the AWS resources affected (e.g., specific S3 buckets).
